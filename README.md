MATLAB scripts for filtering and analyzing data from past game logs for UBC Thunderbots. Included screenshots of some of the changes I made to the C++ source code.

The program transfers the ball data log to an array with the filtered information we need.

How to Run MATLAB Scripts: </br>
1. Download the files </br>
2. Open the sample data "BallData.mat" in MATLAB. </br>
3. Run the scripts in the order: 1) table_to_array.m 2) straight_line_extraction.m 3) squarefit.m </br>

The comments in the scripts explain what each table or array contains and how to read it. 
The scripts are separated to make testing and debugging more convenient.
