MATLAB scripts for filtering data from past game logs for UBC Thunderbots.

The program imports the game log as a table then transfers the data to an array with only the information we need.

How to Run: </br>
1. Download the files </br>
2. Open the sample data "BallData.mat" in MATLAB. </br>
3. Run the scripts in the order: 1) table_to_array.m 2) straight_line_extraction.m 3) squarefit.m </br>

The comments in the script explain what each table or array means and how to read it. 
The scripts are separated to make testing and debugging more convenient.
